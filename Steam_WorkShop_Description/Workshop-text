Optimized version of 'MutLoader' originally made by Flame &amp; Essence, slightly modified by Vel-San;

- If your server is crashing because your 'Server Launch Command' has a lot of mutators, or MapVoteV2 is crashing as well, then this mutator is for you

[b]Changes from the original version[/b]

- Better support with MapVoteV2
- ServerName change with every config

[h1][b][u]Sample Config[/u][/b][/h1]

[code]
[MutLoaderV2.MutLoader]
bDebug=True

[Settings1 MutLoaderObject]
GameTypeName=KFGameType # Can be any gametype you want
GameDifficulty=4.0 # Important if you want to make 2 configs of the same GameType, with different difficulties
ServerName=This is a test server - Diff 4.0 # ServerName will change to this, set to empty if you want to disable
Mutator=Mut1.Mut1
Mutator=Mut1.Mut2
Mutator=Mut1.Mut3

[Settings2 MutLoaderObject]
GameTypeName=KFGameType
GameDifficulty=7.0
ServerName=This is a test server - Diff 7.0
Mutator=Mut1.Mut1
Mutator=Mut1.Mut2
Mutator=Mut1.Mut3
[/code]

[b]Usage with MapVoteV2[/b]

[code]
GameConfig=(GameClass="KFMod.KFGameType",Prefix="KF",Acronym="KF",GameName="Easy",Mutators="MutLoader.MutLoader",Options="Difficulty=1")
GameConfig=(GameClass="KFMod.KFGameType",Prefix="KF",Acronym="KF",GameName="Normal",Mutators="MutLoader.MutLoader",Options="Difficulty=2")
[/code]

No need to put any other mutators in the list of MapVoteV2. What's important is the GameType + Difficulty.
